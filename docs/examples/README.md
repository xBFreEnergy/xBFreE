Here you can find a representation of almost all the types of calculations and analyses that you can perform 
with `xBFreE`. Although each example focuses on specific cases, you can use `xBFreE` on systems that combine 
a number of different components (_i.e._ metalloprotein-ligand complex, Protein-DNA-ligand, etc.). In addition, 
several types of calculations (_e.g._ GB, Alanine scanning and Per-residue decomposition; PB, Interaction Entropy, 
and Per-wise decomposition) can be also performed in the same run for a specific system.

## Systems

This is a representation of the systems that can be processed and analyzed with `xBFreE`. Our program has a robust 
method to process input structures. Even if your system is not represented here, still have a go, you won't 
be disappointed! ðŸ˜€
