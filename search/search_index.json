A ligand .mol2 file is also needed for generating the ligand topology. The <code>mmpbsa. in</code> input file will contain all the parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation. Of note, special parameters  for MMPBSA with membrane proteins have been included.</p> <p>Comments on parameters for implicit membranes</p> <p>The inclusion of an implicit membrane region in implicit solvation calculations is enabled by setting  <code>memopt</code> to 1 (default value is 0, for off). The membrane will extend the solute dielectric region to include a  slab-like planar region of uniform dielectric constant running parallel to the xy plane. The dielectric constant  can be controlled using <code>emem</code>. We set the membrane interior dielectric constant to a value of 7.0 in this example.  The value of <code>emem</code> should always be set to a value greater than or equal to <code>indi</code> (solute dielectric constant,  4 in this example) and less than <code>exdi</code> (solvent dielectric constant, 80.0 default).</p> <p></p> <p>The thickness is controlled by the <code>mthick</code> option (36.086 \u00c5 in this case). The center of the membrane region is  controlled with <code>mctrdz</code> and in this case the membrane region will be centered at -10.383 \u00c5 down of the center  of the protein. If calculations are performed on a protein with a solvent-filled channel region, this  region would be identified automatically by setting <code>poretype=1</code>.</p> <p>When using the implicit membrane model, the default <code>sasopt=0</code>, i.e. the classical solvent excluded surface, is recommended due to its better numerical behavior. When running with the default options, the program  will compute solvent excluded surfaces both with the water probe (<code>prbrad=1.40</code> by default) and the membrane probe (<code>mprob=2.70</code> by default). This setting was found to be consistent with the explicit solvent MD simulations. </p> <p>It is also suggested that periodic boundary conditions be used to avoid unphysical edge effects. This is supported  in all linear solvers. In the following, Geometric multigrid is chosen (<code>solvopt=2</code>) with <code>ipb=1</code> and <code>bcopt=10</code>. The <code>linit=1000</code> should work fine, but take into account that working with linear and periodic boundary conditions  could require more iterations.</p> <p>In addition, <code>eneopt</code> needs to be set to 1 because the charge-view method (<code>eneopt = 2</code>) is not supported for  this application. When <code>eneopt=1</code>, the total electrostatic energy and forces will be  computed with the particle-particle particle-mesh (P3M) procedure outlined in Lu and Luo.[8] In doing so,  energy term <code>EPB</code> in the output file is set to zero, while <code>EEL</code> term includes both the reaction field  energy (<code>EPB</code>) and the Coulombic energy (<code>EEL</code>). The van der Waals energy is computed along with the  particle-particle portion of the Coulombic energy. This option requires a nonzero CUTNB (in this case, <code>cutnb=8.0</code>). It's noteworthy mentioning that <code>\u0394GGAS</code> and <code>\u0394GSOLV</code> as reported are no longer  properly decomposed. Since <code>EPB</code> and <code>EEL</code> are combined into the \"gas phase\" term, the gas and solvation terms  can't be separated. Nevertheless, the total \u0394TOTAL should be perfectly fine, since everything is sum up together  in the end.</p> <p>Danger</p> <p>Note that a smaller <code>fillratio=1.25</code> is used compared to the defult one (4.0). The use of a periodic boundary  also allowed a somewhat small fill ratio (i.e., the ratio of the finite-difference box dimension over the  solute dimension) of 1.25 to be used in these  calculations (ref). Be cautious when changing this  parameter as its increase may lead to a considerable RAM usage (specially when running the program in parralel).

All of that, is  embedded in POPC:CHOL a (4:1) membrane. As you will see, gmx_MMPBSA is able to handle successfully such a complex system. Of note, just a relevant part of the entire system has been considered for binding free calculations, since the  inclusion of the rest will increase the computation time without improving the results. You can check the file  _GMXMMPBSA_COM_FIXED.pdb during the calculation to see how the complex looks like. In this case, a single trajectory  (ST) approximation is followed, which means the receptor and ligand structures and trajectories will be obtained  from that of the complex. To do so, an MD Structure+mass(db) file (<code>com.pdb</code>), an index file (<code>index.ndx</code>), a trajectory  file (<code>md.xtc</code>), and both the receptor and ligand group numbers in the index file (<code>6 5</code>) are needed. The <code>mmpbsa.in</code>  input file will contain all the parameters needed for the MM/PB(GB)SA calculation. A topology file is also needed  (mandatory) in this case to generate the topology files in amber format with all the terms for CHARMM force field.</p> <p>Comments on parameters for implicit membranes</p> <p>The inclusion of an implicit membrane region in implicit solvation calculations is enabled by setting  <code>memopt</code> to 1 (default value is 0, for off). The membrane will extend the solute dielectric region to include a  slab-like planar region of uniform dielectric constant running parallel to the xy plane. The dielectric constant  can be controlled using <code>emem</code>. We set the membrane interior dielectric constant to a value of 7.0 in this example.  The value of <code>emem</code> should always be set to a value greater than or equal to <code>indi</code> (solute dielectric constant,  1 in this example) and less than <code>exdi</code> (solvent dielectric constant, 80.0 default).</p> <p></p> <p>The thickness is controlled by the <code>mthick</code> option (40 \u00c5 in this case). The center of the membrane region is  controlled with <code>mctrdz</code> and in this case the membrane region will be centered at 37 \u00c5 from the center  of the protein. If calculations are performed on a protein with a solvent-filled channel region, this  region would be identified automatically by setting <code>poretype=1</code>.</p> <p>When using the implicit membrane model, the default <code>sasopt=0</code>, i.e. the classical solvent excluded surface, is recommended due to its better numerical behavior. When running with the default options, the program  will compute solvent excluded surfaces both with the water probe (<code>prbrad=1.40</code> by default) and the membrane probe (<code>mprob=2.70</code> by default). This setting was found to be consistent with the explicit solvent MD simulations. </p> <p>It is also suggested that periodic boundary conditions be used to avoid unphysical edge effects. This is supported  in all linear solvers. In the following, Geometric multigrid is chosen (<code>solvopt=2</code>) with <code>ipb=1</code> and <code>bcopt=10</code>. The <code>linit=1000</code> should work fine, but take into account that working with linear and periodic boundary conditions  could require more iterations.</p> <p>In addition, <code>eneopt</code> needs to be set to 1 because the charge-view method (<code>eneopt = 2</code>) is not supported for  this application. When <code>eneopt=1</code>, the total electrostatic energy and forces will be  computed with the particle-particle particle-mesh (P3M) procedure outlined in Lu and Luo.[8] In doing so,  energy term <code>EPB</code> in the output file is set to zero, while <code>EEL</code> term includes both the reaction field  energy (<code>EPB</code>) and the Coulombic energy (<code>EEL</code>). The van der Waals energy is computed along with the  particle-particle portion of the Coulombic energy. This option requires a nonzero CUTNB (in this case, <code>cutnb=8.0</code>). It's noteworthy mentioning that <code>\u0394GGAS</code> and <code>\u0394GSOLV</code> as reported are no longer  properly decomposed. Since <code>EPB</code> and <code>EEL</code> are combined into the \"gas phase\" term, the gas and solvation terms  can't be separated. Nevertheless, the total \u0394TOTAL should be perfectly fine, since everything is sum up together  in the end.</p> <p>Danger</p> <p>Note that a smaller <code>fillratio=1.25</code> is used compared to the defult one (4.0). The use of a periodic boundary  also allowed a somewhat small fill ratio (i.e., the ratio of the finite-difference box dimension over the  solute dimension) of 1.25 to be used in these  calculations (ref). Be cautious when changing this  parameter as its increase may lead to a considerable RAM usage (specially when running the program in parralel).</p> <p>A plain text output file with all the statistics (default: <code>FINAL_RESULTS_MMPBSA.dat</code>) and a CSV-format  output file containing all energy terms for every frame in every calculation will be saved.

In HPC, admins recommend using a virtual environment (virtualenv) instead of conda to take advantage of optimized  compiled programs. In this case, you will require AmberTools, Gromacs, and other dependencies previously compiled  (generally as modules). The required libraries for each dependency will depend on the HPC the user is working on. A  good example and how the virtualenv works in an HPC can be  found here. <code>AmberTools compilation</code> (Recommended when you need to modify sander or compile AmberTools in a specific way) <p>This way, we assume that you have AmberTools compiled on your machine and that you want to do an installation  without worrying about enabling or disabling conda environments. It also involves user compilation of GROMACS, which  takes considerable installation time.

The solvation energy is  determined differently, depending on the method employed. In the 3D-RISM model, both components -polar and non-polar-  of the solvation energy are calculated. However, the PB and GB models estimate only the polar component of the  solvation. The non-polar component is usually assumed to be proportional to the molecule's total solvent accessible  surface area (SASA), with a proportionality constant derived from experimental solvation energies of small non-polar  molecules (eq. 7). Alternatively, a modern approach that separates non-polar solvation free energies into cavity and  dispersion terms can be used. In this approach, SASA is used to correlate the cavity term only, while a  surface-integration method is employed to compute the dispersion term (eq. 8).</p> <p>Furthermore, the entropic component is usually calculated by normal modes analysis (NMODE). The translational and rotational entropies can be estimated using standard statistical mechanical formulas. Nevertheless, calculating  vibrational entropy using normal modes is computationally expensive because it requires expanding the internal  coordinate covariance matrix for all degrees of freedom for a set of minimized structures. Conversely, the  Quasi-harmonic (QH) approximation is less computationally expensive, although it requires a considerable number of frames to converge. Recently, other alternatives have been developed, such as NMODE in truncated systems,  which considerably reduces the computational cost. Interaction Entropy (IE) is another novel method that  calculates the entropic component of the binding free energy directly from MD simulations without any extra  computational cost. This method is numerically reliable, more computationally efficient, and superior to the  standard NMODE approach, as shown in an extensive study of over a dozen randomly selected protein-ligand binding  systems.</p> <p>Typically, two approaches are used for MM/PB(GB)SA calculations, known as Single Trajectory Protocol (STP) and  Multiple Trajectory Protocol (MTP). In STP, both the receptor and the ligand trajectories are extracted  from that of the complex. This approach is valid when the bound and unbound states of the receptor, and the ligand  are similar. It is computationally less expensive than the MTP approach since only a simulation of the complex is  required. Additionally, the potential internal terms (e.g., bonds, angles, and dihedrals) cancel exactly in STP  since these terms are the same in both bound and unbound states. On the other hand, the MTP is a more realistic  approach because it considers multiple trajectories (i.e., complex, receptor, and ligand). However, significant  conformational changes can lead to numerous errors. In practice, a detailed study of the system is required to  select the approach to be used.</p>"},{"location":"mmpbsa/#literature","title":"Literature","text":"<p>Further information can be found in Amber manual:</p> <ul> <li>MMPBSA.py</li> <li>The Generalized Born/Surface Area Model</li> <li>PBSA</li> <li>Reference Interaction Site Model</li> <li>Generalized Born (GB) for QM/MM calculations</li> </ul> <p>and the foundational papers:</p> <ul> <li>Srinivasan J. et al., 1998 </li> <li>Kollman P.

The number of temporary files could be considerable depending  on the type of calculation, reaching an absurd amount when many CPUs were used in parallel. A large number of files  in a folder presents several problems. First, since it is generated in the same folder as the input files, it is  hard to use them. Second, because of the large number, it becomes problematic to find a specific file. Lastly,  folders with many files are not easy to handle for the GUI of operating systems due to indexing.    Therefore, we decided to make some changes in the working directory structure. Now, a folder called xBFReE_RESULTS is  generated and then a folder is generated for each type of calculation, currently only  mmpbsa, which contains all the temporary files.

It will also show the names of all files  that were used in the calculation (topology files and coordinate file(s)). If the masks were not specified, it prints its best guess so that you can verify its accuracy, along with the residue name of the ligand (if it is only a single residue). After that, general information about methods, units, constants used is  included. Entropy results are shown next in case any entropy approximation was used. Next, the energy and entropy  contributions are broken up into their components as they are in <code>sander</code> and <code>nmode</code> or <code>cpptraj</code>. The contributions  are further broken for the complex, receptor and ligand into <code>GGAS</code> and <code>GSOLV</code>. <code>GGAS</code> is the interaction energy  and is obtained after adding the internal(bonded) components (<code>BOND</code> + <code>ANGLE</code> + <code>DIHED</code>) and the  non-bonded (<code>VDWAALS</code> + <code>EEL</code>) components. For <code>GSOLV</code>, the polar and non-polar contributions are <code>EGB</code> (or <code>EPB</code>)  and <code>ESURF</code> (or <code>ENPOLAR + EDISPER</code>), respectively for <code>GB</code> (or <code>PB</code>) calculations. A single trajectory protocol does  not produce any differences between bond lengths, angles, dihedrals or 1-4 interactions between the complex and  receptor/ligand structures. Thus, when subtracted, they cancel completely. If not, these values are displayed and  inconsistency warnings are printed. When this occurs, the results are generally useless. Of course, this does not  hold for the multiple trajectory protocol as independent trajectories are used for the complex, receptor and ligand.  Two approaches are used when calculating the standard deviation and the standard error of the mean. The <code>SD</code> and <code>SEM</code> values are calculated using a sample (array) of values. On the other hand, <code>SD(Prop.)</code> and <code>SEM(Prop.)</code> are  obtained with the  propagation of uncertainty formula for  f = A - B.
