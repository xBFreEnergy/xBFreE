# Contribution guide

## How to start?

You can contribute in multiples ways:
- Reporting an issue
- Requesting a new feature
- Testing the code and the software in different PC configurations and OS
- Improving the code
- Checking the documentation content
- Generating a new o improving the current BFE methods
- and much more...

For issues reporting we have created a template, which contains almost everything needed to identify the problem. 

## Step-by-step guide

### Before reporting an issue, requesting a new feature or asking a question:

Please ensure that you have read the following docs:
- [Documentation and FAQ](docs/Q&A/README.md)
- [Examples section](docs/examples/README.md)
- [Previous reported issues](https://github.com/xBFreEnergy/xBFreE/issues)
- [Previous discussions](https://groups.google.com/g/xbfree-reports)

### To implement a new feature

1. Firstly, open an issue with your feature description, and we can discuss the design and its implementation details;
2. Once we decide how to move forward, create a Pull Request with the new feature implemented.

### Bugfix

1. Go to [GitHub issues](https://github.com/xBFreEnergy/xBFreE/issues);
2. Pick an issue and comment on the task that you want to work on this feature;
3. If you need more context on a specific issue, please ask, and we will discuss the details.
4. Once we decide how to move forward, create a Pull Request with the code to solve the issue.

If you are not familiar with creating a Pull Request, here are some guides:

### Documentation

xBFreE Project, xBFreE and xBFreE-Analyzer have their own documentations based in Mkdocs-Material. We additionally 
use external plugins and modified code to optimize the content.

For the code documetation, xBFreE uses [Google style](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) 
for formatting [docstrings](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings).
Length of a line inside docstrings block must be limited to 100 characters to fit into Jupyter documentation popups.

If you have some issues with building docs - please make sure that you installed the required pip packages.

### Tests
